#+TITLE: Beacon --- Never lose your cursor again

This is a global minor-mode.  Turn it on everywhere with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(beacon-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

[[file:example-beacon.gif]]

Whenever the window scrolls or the buffer changes a light will shine
on top of your cursor so you know where it is.

Thatâ€™s it.

** Customizations

- To customize the appearance of the beacon, configure
  ~beacon-size~ and ~beacon-color~.

- To customize how long it lasts, configure ~beacon-blink-duration~
  and ~beacon-blink-delay~.

- To customize /when/ it is used at all, configure
  ~beacon-blink-when-window-scrolls~,
  ~beacon-blink-when-buffer-changes~, and
  ~beacon-blink-when-point-moves~.
