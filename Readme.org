#+TITLE: Spotlight --- Never lose your cursor again

This is a global minor-mode.  Turn it on everywhere with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spotlight-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Whenever point moves a long distance (as defined by
~spotlight-minimum-distance~) a light will shine on top of your cursor
to make sure you see where it is.

- To customize the appearance of the spotlight, configure
  ~spotlight-size~ and ~spotlight-brightness~.

- To customize how long it lasts, configure ~spotlight-blink-duration~
  and ~spotlight-blink-delay~.

- To customize when it is used at all, configure
  ~spotlight-minimum-distance~ and
  ~spotlight-blink-when-buffer-changes~.
